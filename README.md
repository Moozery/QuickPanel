QuickPanel application for Android


QuickPanel is an application for Android 2.2 and up. It is designed to reduce the amount of menus required 
to go through in Android to access basic and daily-used options. The application was originally started
as a highschool computer engineering final project, the educational development blog can be found at 
http://kylevanhorne17.blogspot.ca/, which is now used for educational posts about Android and Java, but still includes 
the application's code and other files, posts, etcetera.

Currently, the application is not available on Google Play, but most likely will be soon.
